Embedding YouTube Videos
========================

Staring in 0.18, it is possible to embedd a YouTube video inside a Bootstrap column. When adding
a plugin to a column, select the **YouTube**. The YouTube URL is found by clicking on the **SHARE**
button, then copying and pasting it into the URL field in the editor. Select the right aspect
ratio, otherwise you end up with right and left edged cut away.

For all other options, the YouTube plugin editor offers, consult the `IFrame Player API`_.
